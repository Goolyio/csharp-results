# csharp-results

A flexible library for wrapping responses and errors into a result object

## Problem

Every project seems to have its own generic results implementation as its not native to any .NET libraries. This seems silly to me and a lightweight flexible result package could be used instead. There have been a few packages that have tried to do this, the most popular being [FluentResults](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults) but in my opinion it feels very rigid to use esspecially around error response types.

[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharpResults/)
